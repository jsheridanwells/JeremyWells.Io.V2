<!-- ## Developer, Dad, Dog Lover, Deadhead -->
![Site Author](../assets/img/about-me-artie.jpg)
I am a second-career senior software engineer currently working in the health care sector. Before that, I was a public school EL teacher. And before that, I wandered South America, often on bicycles. I work form a home office in Detroit, MI with Artie, the little brown vizslaraner.

I'm currently heavily involved in event-driven services and data pipelines and spend most of my day in .NET and Azure Data Factory. I'm also quite conversant in Node.js and Angular and I'm always trying to be better about jotting down what I learn along the way. Hopefully more of that will end up here.
