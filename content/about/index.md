## Developer, Dad, Dog Lover, Deadhead

I am a second-career software engineer currently working in the health care sector. Before that, I was a public school EL teacher. And before that, I wandered South America, often on bicycles.

I'm mainly conversant in .NET, Angular, Node.js, MS SQL, Typescript, Docker, and Azure and I'm always trying to be better about jotting down what I learn along the way. Hopefully more of that will end up here.
